# Game Development Scripts

Repository containing scripts created on the process of learning game programming, initially only Unity with C# but might be expanded at a later date. 

All the projects will be uploaded to itch.io at a later date.

## 2D Platformer

Basic 2D platformer created using Unity's older input system, has no vitory state (will be fixed). Created as the first project on the Game Development Course in my Software Engineering University.
